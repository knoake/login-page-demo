# Login Page Demo

[Login page demo](https://knoake.github.io/login-page-demo/)

The login page is responsive and supports device sizes down to iphone SE.

The application will use the system theme for light and dark modes.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.10.

## Known issues

A light logo for dark mode needs sourcing.

A lighter primary colour should be used in dark mode.

The custom theme currently only uses a single shade of the motorola primary colour.

## Testing the login

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

To build the demo project to GitHub pages run `ng build --output-path docs --base-href /login-page-demo/`. A copy of index.html must be created and renamed 404.html.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
